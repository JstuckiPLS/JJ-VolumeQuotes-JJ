EDI table is a log table. It contains all EDI messages we get from Adeptia. CARRIERS.EDI_CAPABLE is an flag to identify if we can generate EDI
messages for Carriers. Some carriers wont support EDI and for those carriers we need to make webservice call or phone call.
EDI.status values:
R = Running, C = Completed, P = Processing, X = Cancelled, E = Errored. We wont use EDI table for this business scenario
