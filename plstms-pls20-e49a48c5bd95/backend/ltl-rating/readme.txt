To run the SOAPUI tests, you need import DayrossShipmentServices-soapui-project to SOAPUI App, 
and then open "ShipmentServisesSoap"  directory. Finally move to "GetRate" test and run it.

Test request is located inside the directory with this file, it is called request.txt

If the SoapUI doesn't return data, make sure that you have the correct endpoint like: http://dayross.ca/public/shipmentservices.asmx
