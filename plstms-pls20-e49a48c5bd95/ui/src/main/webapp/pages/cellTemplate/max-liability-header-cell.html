        LTL carriers establish their own limits of liability (typically per pound and per shipment) in their rules tariff documents which are posted<br>
        on their websites. Many carriers also have extensive lists of specific commodities that carry even further reduced liability limits such<br>
        as electronics, safes, furniture, spa covers, household goods, machinery, glass & glassware for example. The PLS Pro system<br>
        displays the estimated maximum carrier liability for the quoted class only and represents the best case settlement for a total loss of a<br>
        shipment scenario.  The estimates are meant to provide the user with a general comparison of liability levels of coverage among<br>
        carriers. The estimates do not take into account any special commodity NMFC restrictions, effects of FAK/exception class variances,<br>
        spot/volume quote/pallet rate limitations, condition (new/ used/ refurbished), or packaging type and are subject to change by the<br>
        carriers without notice. When in doubt, we highly recommend you contact the PLS Operations team at the time of booking to make<br>
        sure there are no carrier liability restrictions or reductions for your particular shipment.  PLS offers full value cargo insurance<br>
        coverage at extremely competitive rates to further protect you from an unexpected loss.
